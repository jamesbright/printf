## Custom printf function in c. project task of ALX Software Engineering Shool
0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life
Write a function that produces output according to a format.

Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
write output to stdout, the standard output stream
format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
c
s
%
You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't
mandatory
Handle the following conversion specifiers:

d
i
You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

2. With a face like mine, I do better in print

Handle the following custom conversion specifiers:

b: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary


3. What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print
Handle the following conversion specifiers:

u
o
x
X
You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

4. Nothing in fine print is ever good news
Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call write as little as possible.

5. My weakness is wearing too much leopard print
Handle the following custom conversion specifier:

S : prints the string.
Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters)

6. How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print

Handle the following conversion specifier: p.

You don’t have to handle the flag characters
You don’t have to handle field width
You don’t have to handle precision
You don’t have to handle the length modifiers
